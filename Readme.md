<p align="center">A collection of my favourite Windows 10 tweaks</p


### Intro

This is my collection of Windows 10 tweaks, settings and tricks to make it better and remove the bloatware that annoys me.

Everything is optional, they're just my favourite settings.



## Step 0: BACKUP!

Back up your registry, because if everything goes south, you should be able to restore the old registry and therefore reset all tweaks.

1. Open Registry Editor:
   Press **Win** + **r** and type in `regedit`
2. Go to *File* And then *Export*, set export range to *All* and save it.

If you'll have to restore the settings, simply go to *File* and *Import* the `.reg` file.



## Step 1: Registry

Download the `winit.reg` file, right click it, then *Edit*.

Here you can see the changes the file will make. If you don't want to apply a particular setting, just put a `;` before the corresponding lines.

When you're finished, exit the editor, and double click on the file to apply it.



## Step 2: Additional Software

These are free software for improving your overall experience. Remember, everything is optional.

### 1. T-clock

T-clock is an open source clock replacement for Windows 10.

You can download it from [here](https://github.com/White-Tiger/T-Clock/releases).

It's highly customizable, but I usually adjust the time format only.
My time format is `mmm d ddd â€¢ H:nn`.
You can get help about time format symbols by clicking on the *T-clock help.rtf* button in the settings.

*(Also, it's advised to start T-clock on system startup. You can find a checkbox for this in the settings)*
